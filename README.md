This is the repository for everyday challenge in Javascript with datastructure

# Day 1 <br>
## Arrays
In day one i learned about array in javascript and different operations of arrays.

<br>

An array is an ordered list of values, each value is called an element specified by index. <br>

A javascript array has the following characteristics ---> <br>
1. It can hold mixed types, for example it can hholds elements with the types number, string, boolean and null. <br>

2. The size of the array is dynamic and auto growing, in other word we don't need to specify the array size up front.<br>

Basic Operation of Arrays : <br>

1. Adding an element to the ened of an array :
<br>
To add an element to the end of an array we use push() method.
<br>

2. Adding an element to the beginning of an array.<br>
To add an element to the beginning of an arra we use the unshift() method.<br>

3. Removing an element from the end of an array :<br>
To remove an element from the end of an array we use pop() method<br>

4. Removing an element from the beginning of an array<br>

To remove an element from the beginning of an array we use the shift() method<br>

5. Finding an index of an element in the array<br>

To find an index of an element we use the indexOf() method.<br>

6. Check if a value is an array <br>
To check if a value is an array we use Array.isArray() method.<br>



# Day 2 <br>
Array methods and some basic operations.<br>

1. Converting an array to string.<br>
To convert array to String we use arrayName.toString() method.<br>

2. The difference between arrays and objects.<br>
In javascript arrays use numbered indexes.<br>
In Javascript, Object use named indexes.<br>

3. When to use arrays and when to use objects.<br>
-> Javascript doesnot support associative arrays.<br>
-> We should use objects when we want the element names to be string(text).<br>
-> We should use arrays when we want the element names to be numbers.<br>

### Different array methods. <br>
1. join() : <br>
-> join() method is used to combine the elements of an array into a single string.<br>
-> We can specify a delimeter(a string that separates the elelments), and the join() method will join the array elements together with that delimeter and return the resulting array.<br>
-> If we don't specify a delimeter a comma(',') will be used by default.<br>
-> Example : array.join([separator]).<br>

2. splice() : <br>
-> spllice() method is used to change the contents of an array by removing or adding elements to it.<br>
-> The splice() method can be used to perform variety of array manipulation operationns.<br>

3. slice() : <br>

-> slice() is used to extract a portion of an array and create a new array containing the selected elements. The slice() method doesnot modify the original array instead it returns a new array with the specified elements.<br> 

### Problem solved of the Day.<br>
1. Counting the array elements.
2. Counting the even number and odd number elements in the array.
3. Sum of the array elements 
4. Mean of the array elements.



# Day 3
1. Revision the Array basics
2. Practice different array methods 


# Day 4
### Problem solved
1. Finding highest element in the array
2. Finding second highest element in the array
3. Finding small elelment in the array
4. Finding second smallest element in the array


# Day 5 (String)
 - String are primitive values.
 - Strings are immutable, It means that if we modify a string we will always get an new string.
 - The original String doesnot change.
 - To create literal string we use single quotes(') or double quotes(").
 - ES6 intrroduce template literals also so we can use.
 - Accessing string character
 - String concatenation.
 - Convert non-string to string




 # Day 6 (Objects)
 * Learn about objects
 * Declaration of Objects (singleton/literals)
 * Using symbol in Objects
 * Adding functions in the objects
 * Understanding Nested objects how we can access.
 * Combining the multiple objects using Object.assign method
 * Combining the multiple objects using spread operators
 * Used the different methods like Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries(), Object.hasOwnProperty('targetName')
